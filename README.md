## 02 Features 🚀

### 1. Secure Appointment Booking

### 2. Three-Tier Authentication
*We implement a comprehensive three-tier authentication system that includes:*
- `Patients:` Secure access for patients to manage their appointments.
- `Doctors:` Verified access for healthcare professionals to view and manage their schedules.
- `Admins:` Administrative control with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

### 3. Integrated Payments
We've integrated `Razorpay` to facilitate secure online payments, allowing users to conveniently pay appointment fees directly through the platform. This ensures a smooth and efficient payment process for both patients and healthcare providers.
